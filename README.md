## My process
oops... I tried to set the basics, guessing which structure would be correct, then focused on details.. 

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow (I tried...)

### What I learned
I used this challenge to practice CSS flexbox.


### Continued development
I still need to practice CSS flexbox. Maybe doing this challenge a second time to see if I can have something cleaner.

### Useful resources
- [Complete guide to flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - All flexbox explained in this guide.
